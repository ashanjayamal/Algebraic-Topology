Roughly it’s about tools/methods connecting algebra and topology. The “bridge” is algebraic topology. In order to be useful, the associations \\[ X ⇝ G(X) \\quad \\text{and} \\quad f ⇝ \\varphi_f \\] ought to satisfy some properties. Property Mathematical Form Identity Preservation \\(\\mathrm{id}_X : X \\to X \\; ⇝ \\; \\mathrm{id}_{G(X)} : G(X) \\to G(X)\\) Composition Compatibility If \\(f : X \\to Y\\) and \\(g : Y \\to Z\\), then \\((g \\circ f) : X \\to Z \\; ⇝ \\; \\varphi_{g \\circ f}=\\varphi_g \\circ \\varphi_f : G(X) \\to G(Z)\\) In somewhat “fancy” language, we are asking that the correspondence above be functor So, what could we do with all this? Example 1.1 (Classical Problem) Let \\(S^1 \\subset D^2\\) be the unit circle inside the unit disk in \\(\\mathbb{R}^2\\).Suppose we are given a continuous map \\(f : S^1 \\to S^1.\\) Does there exist a continuous extension \\(g : D^2 \\to S^1\\) such that \\(g(z) = f(z)\\) for all \\(z \\in S^1\\)? \\[ \\begin{aligned} &amp; S^1 \\xrightarrow{f} S^1 \\\\ &amp; \\downarrow i \\quad \\nearrow \\mathbf{?~\\exists} ~g \\\\ &amp; D^2 \\end{aligned} \\] Imagine we had our algebraic topology tools on hand. If there exists a continuous map \\(g : D^2 \\rightarrow S^1\\) such that \\(g \\circ j = f,\\) then the induced homomorphism satisfies \\[ \\varphi_f = \\varphi_{g \\circ j} = \\varphi_g \\circ \\varphi_j. \\] That is, the existence of \\(g\\) would imply the existence of a homomorphism \\(\\varphi_g\\) such that the following diagram commutes: Proof. \\[ \\begin{aligned} &amp; G(S^1) \\xrightarrow{\\varphi_f} G(S^1) \\\\ &amp; \\downarrow \\varphi_j \\quad \\nearrow \\varphi_g \\\\ &amp; G(D^2) \\end{aligned} \\] “Commutes” mean \\(\\varphi_f = \\varphi_g \\circ \\varphi_j.\\) Suppose we know, \\(G(S^1) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}\\) \\(G(D^2) \\cong \\{ e \\}\\) (the trivial group) \\(\\varphi_f\\) is a non-trivial homomorphism, i.e., \\(\\varphi_f(a) \\neq 0 \\text{ for all } a \\in G(S^1)\\) is a generator. This yields a contradiction, since any composition through the trivial group must be trivial. Therefore, no such map \\(g\\) can exist. Definition: Invaraince (This is not a formal definition) Suppose \\(G\\) is a correspondence of the kind we’re looking for: \\[\\begin{cases} X &amp;⇝ G(X) \\\\ X \\xrightarrow{f} Y &amp;⇝ G(X) \\xrightarrow{G(f)} G(Y) \\end{cases}\\] such that:\\[G(\\mathrm{id}_X) = \\mathrm{id}_{G(X)}, \\quad G(f \\circ g) = G(f) \\circ G(g).\\] Then observe that it’s automatic that Result :If \\(f: X \\to Y\\) is a homeomorphism, then \\(G(f): G(X) \\to G(Y)\\) is an isomorphism. Proof. Homeomorphism: A function \\({\\displaystyle f:X\\to Y}\\) is a homeomorphism if \\({\\displaystyle f}\\) is a bijection (one-to-one and onto), \\({\\displaystyle f}\\) is continuous, \\({\\displaystyle f^{-1}}\\) is continuous Isomorphism Hormphism Bijective Let \\(f^{-1}: Y \\to X\\) be the inverse of \\(f\\). Then \\(f^{-1} \\circ f = \\mathrm{id}_X\\). So, \\[\\begin{align*} \\mathrm{id}_{G(X)} &amp;= G(\\mathrm{id}_X) = G(f^{-1} \\circ f) = G(f^{-1}) \\circ G(f) \\\\ \\mathrm{id}_{G(Y)} &amp;= G(\\mathrm{id}_Y) = G(f \\circ f^{-1}) = G(f) \\circ G(f^{-1}) \\end{align*}\\] Hence,\\(G(f^{-1}) = G(f)^{-1}\\). Therefore, homeomorphic spaces \\(X, Y\\) yield isomorphic groups,\\(G(X) \\cong G(Y)\\) (We say \\(G(X)\\) is an invariant of \\(X\\).) \\[ \\text{A necessary condition for two spaces } X, Y \\text{ to be homeomorphic is that } G(X) \\cong G(Y). \\] Remark. We’ll see examples showing this is NOT sufficient. 1.1 Some Basic defnitions Definition 1.1 (Homotopy of Maps) Let \\(X, Y\\) be topological spaces, and let \\(f, g : X \\to Y\\) be continuous maps. We say that \\(f\\) is homotopic to \\(g\\), and write \\(f \\sim g\\), if there exists a continuous map \\[ H : X \\times I \\to Y \\] such that \\[ H(x,0) = f(x), \\qquad H(x,1) = g(x) \\quad \\text{for all } x \\in X. \\] Intuitively, the map \\(H\\) defines a continuous deformation of \\(f\\) into \\(g\\) over time \\(t \\in [0,1]\\). Notations: We often write \\(H_t : X \\to Y\\) for the slice \\(H(\\cdot,t)\\), so that \\(H_0 = f, \\quad H_1 = g.\\) Sometimes we write \\(f \\overset{H}{\\sim} g\\) to indicate the specific homotopy \\(H\\). Example 1.2 Let \\(f, g : X \\to \\mathbb{R}^n\\) be any continuous functions. Then \\(f \\sim g\\), because we can define a homotopy: \\[ H(x,t) = t\\, g(x) + (1 - t)\\, f(x) \\] This map \\(H : X \\times I \\to \\mathbb{R}^n\\) is continuous (since vector space operations in \\(\\mathbb{R}^n\\) are continuous), and satisfies: \\[ H_0 = f, \\qquad H_1 = g \\] Definition 1.2 Let \\(A \\subset X\\), and suppose \\(f|_A = g|_A\\), i.e., \\(f(a) = g(a)\\) for all \\(a \\in A\\). We say that \\(f\\) is homotopic to \\(g\\) relative to \\(A\\) if there exists a homotopy \\[ H : X \\times I \\to Y \\] such that \\[ H(a,t) = f(a) = g(a) \\quad \\text{for all } a \\in A, \\text{ and all } t \\in [0,1]. \\] Example 1.3 Let \\(f, g : I \\to \\mathbb{R}^2\\) be continuous maps (paths), as illustrated. Then the interpolation homotopy is a homotopy from \\(f\\) to \\(g\\), and it satisfies \\[ H(0,t) = f(0) = g(0), \\qquad H(1,t) = f(1) = g(1) \\] for all \\(t \\in [0,1]\\). Hence, \\(H\\) is a homotopy relative to the endpoints \\(\\{0,1\\} \\subset I\\). Notation: When \\(f\\) is homotopic to \\(g\\) relative to a subset \\(A \\subset X\\), we write:\\(f \\sim g \\text{ rel } A\\) This means there exists a homotopy \\(H : X \\times I \\to Y\\) such that \\[ H(a,t) = f(a) = g(a) \\quad \\text{for all } a \\in A, \\, t \\in [0,1]. \\] Example 1.4 Let \\(f, g, h : X \\to Y\\) be continuous maps between topological spaces. We show that the relation \\(f \\sim g\\) (homotopy) satisfies reflexivity, symmetry, and transitivity. Reflexivity \\[ f \\sim f \\quad \\text{via } H(x,t) = f(x) \\text{ for all } t \\in [0,1]. \\] This is a constant homotopy. Symmetry Suppose \\(f \\sim g\\) via homotopy \\(H(x,t)\\). Then define: \\[ G(x,t) = H(x,1 - t) \\] This reverses the deformation and gives a homotopy from \\(g\\) to \\(f\\), so \\(g \\sim f\\). Transitivity Suppose \\(f \\sim g\\) via \\(F(x,t)\\), and \\(g \\sim h\\) via \\(G(x,t)\\). Define a new homotopy \\(H : X \\times I \\to Y\\) by: \\[ H(x,t) = \\begin{cases} F(x,2t) &amp; \\text{if } 0 \\le t \\le \\tfrac12, \\\\ G(x,2t - 1) &amp; \\text{if } \\tfrac12 \\le t \\le 1. \\end{cases} \\] Then: \\[ H(x,0) = F(x,0) = f(x), \\qquad H(x,1) = G(x,1) = h(x). \\] By the pasting lemma (Lemma 1.1), \\(F(x,1) = g(x) = G(x,0)\\), so \\(H\\) is continuous. Thus, \\(f \\sim h\\). Let me recall pasting lemma, if you can not remember, Lemma 1.1 (Pasting Lemma) Let \\(X, Y\\) be both closed (or both open) subsets of a topological space \\(A\\) such that \\[ A = X \\cup Y, \\] and let \\(B\\) be a topological space. If \\(f : A \\to B\\) is continuous when restricted to both \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\), then \\(f\\) is continuous. Definition 1.3 Let \\(X\\) b∈topological space and \\(x_0\\in X\\). Let \\(\\Pi_1(X,x_0)\\) denote the set of homotpy equivalnce classes of loops based at \\(x_0\\). (i.e.: \\(\\sigma I \\rightarrow X, \\sigma(0)=sigma(1)=x_0\\), where homotopy relative to \\(\\{0,1\\}\\)) Definition 1.4 Let \\(X\\) be a topological space, and let \\(x_0 \\in X\\). Define \\(\\pi_1(X, x_0)\\) to be the set of homotopy equivalence classes of loops based at \\(x_0\\) (i.e., maps \\(\\alpha : I \\to X \\quad \\text{with } \\alpha(0) = \\alpha(1) = x_0,\\) where homotopy is taken rel \\(\\{0,1\\}\\)). i.e.: \\[\\begin{align*} \\Pi(X,x_0) &amp;= \\left\\{ [\\sigma]: \\sigma \\text{ is a loop at }x_0\\right\\}, \\text{ where. }\\\\ &amp; [\\sigma]=\\left\\{\\alpha: \\sigma \\text{ is a loop at }x_0 \\text{ and } \\sigma \\sim \\alpha\\right\\} \\end{align*}\\] Remark. The previous lemma shows that concatenation gives a well-defined binary operation on \\(\\pi_1(X, x_0)\\) \\[ [\\sigma][\\tau] \\mapsto [\\sigma * \\tau], \\] where \\(*\\) denotes concatenation and the constant path acts as identity. Theorem 1.1 \\(\\pi_1(X, x_0)\\) is a group under this operation, with: Neutral element: \\([c]\\), where \\(c\\) is the constant loop at \\(x_0\\). Inverse: For \\([\\sigma]\\), the inverse is \\([\\sigma^{-1}]\\), where \\[ \\sigma^{-1}(t) = \\sigma(1 - t). \\] Proof. Closedness Associvity: NTS: $([][]) [] = $. First note that We need to show $() () $ \\[\\begin{align*} (\\alpha \\beta)(s) &amp;:= \\begin{cases} \\alpha(2s), &amp; 0 \\le s \\le \\tfrac{1}{2}, \\\\[6pt] \\beta(2s - 1), &amp; \\tfrac{1}{2} \\le s \\le 1 . \\end{cases}\\\\ (\\alpha \\beta)\\gamma(s) &amp;:=\\begin{cases} \\alpha\\beta(2s), &amp; 0 \\le s \\le \\tfrac{1}{2}, \\\\[6pt] \\gamma(2s - 1), &amp; \\tfrac{1}{2} \\le s \\le 1 . \\end{cases}\\\\ &amp;:=\\begin{cases} \\alpha(4s), &amp; 0 \\le s \\le \\tfrac{1}{4}, \\\\[6pt] \\beta(4s - 1), &amp; \\tfrac{1}{4} \\le s \\le \\frac{1}{2} .\\\\[6pt] \\gamma(2s - 1), &amp; \\tfrac{1}{2} \\le s \\le 1 . \\end{cases}\\\\ \\end{align*}\\] We picture these paths by the diagrams, The diagrams can be used to obtain the algebraic descriptions of the paths in question quite easily. For example, consider \\((\\alpha * \\beta) * \\gamma\\). When t &lt; $ we use \\(\\beta\\) and compose it with a linear function that changes the interval \\([\\tfrac14, \\tfrac12]\\) to \\([0,1]\\), namely \\[ t \\mapsto 4t - 1. \\] In fact, any continuous function from \\([\\tfrac14, \\tfrac12]\\) to \\([0,1]\\) which sends \\(\\tfrac14\\) to \\(0\\) and \\(\\tfrac12\\) to \\(1\\) will do , but it is usually easiest to choose a linear function. Idenitity: NTS: \\([c_{x_0}][\\sigma]= [\\sigma]\\) for all \\(\\sigma \\in \\Pi_1(X,x_0)\\) We need to show \\(c_{x_0}\\sigma\\sim\\sigma\\) for all \\(\\sigma \\in \\Pi_1(X,x_0)\\) ``` "],["hj.html", "Chapter 2 hj", " Chapter 2 hj "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
